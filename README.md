# About this Project

This project is an attempt to do some research on playing music from the browser.

At the moment it just plays single notes, which was very simple to do.  I am working on
figuring out how to do more complex things.  The component called `Arpeggiator` is an attempt
to do that, but it doesn't work properly right now.

I've done this all in React because I don't know Angular so well and I'm trying to work with as
few unknowns as possible, but ultimately this is research for a project that will use Angular.
