# About this Project

This project is an attempt to do some research on playing music from the browser.

Everything of interest is in `src/components`

At the moment it just plays single notes, which was very simple to do.  I am working on
figuring out how to do more complex things.  The component called `Arpeggiator` is an attempt
to do that, but it doesn't work properly right now.

I've done this all in React because I don't know Angular so well and I'm trying to work with as
few unknowns as possible, but ultimately this is research for a project that will use Angular.

I don't think there will be any huge differences in sound implementation between the frameworks.

There is a build of this at:
